# üêà MeowVapor

MeowVapor bridges [Meow](https://github.com/openkitten/meow) to Vapor and provides awesome helpers for creating a Meow based Vapor app/API.

### Add the dependency

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/OpenKitten/MeowVapor.git", from: "2.0.0")
```

Add MeowVapor as a dependency via SPM and run `swift package update`.

## Setting up

Add Meow to your Vapor services. Be sure to change the MongoDB URI to point to your server.

```swift
let meow = try MeowProvider(uri: "mongodb://localhost")
try services.register(meow)
```

## Using MeowVapor

```swift
router.get { request -> Future<[User]> in
   let context = try request.make(Meow.Context.self)
   return context.find(User.self).getAllResults()
}
```

## Creating models

When creating a Model you need to conform your `class` to `Model`. 
The only requirement is that you add a property to your model with a key of `_id` and is _not_ a computed property.

```swift
final class User: Model {
  var _id = ObjectId()
  
  ...
}
```

You can use any type for the `_id` key as long as it's a standard BSON `Primitive` type including:

- ObjectId
- String
- Double
- Int
- Int32
- `Binary` / `Data`

The following is completely legitimate:

```swift
// Stores the username in _id
final class User: Model {
  var _id: String
  
  var username: String {
    return _id
  }
  
  ...
```

By default the model name will be used for the collection name. You can customize this with a `static let collectionName: String`

```swift
final class User: Model {
  // Changes the collection name from `User` to `users`
  static let collectionName = "users"

  var _id = ObjectId()
  
  ...
```

## Queries

Queries reside within the `Context`.

### References

```swif
final class Article: Model {
  var _id = ObjectId()
  let creator: Reference<User>
  var title: String
  var text: String
  
  ...
```

The above demonstrates how a simple reference can be created to another model. In this case a User model. And below demonstrates resolving the reference.

```swift
let resolvedUser = article.creator.resolve(in: context)
```

The result in this case is an `EventLoopFuture<User>`, but if you wish to resolve the reference's target to `nil` if it doesn't exist you can simply do `article.creator.resolveIfPresent(in: context)`.

You're also able to delete the target of the reference using `reference.deleteTarget(in: context)`. This implies that resolving the normal way (not with `ifPresent`) will result in a failure.

### Unsupported MongoDB features

If a feature is unsupported by Meow, for example when it can't be type-safe, you can always fall back to [MongoKitten](https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten.git).

```swift
let database: MongoKitten.Database = context.manager.database
```
